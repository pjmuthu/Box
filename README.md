# Box

This repository contains the source code for the Model Based Reasoning project, which is aimed at using the Mystery Box software to gain experience in solving problems using a modeling approach. The project focuses on understanding the behaviors of different types of mystery boxes and developing scientific models to explain their observations and make predictions.

1. **Menu Navigation**:
   - When the program starts, you will see a menu screen.
   - Click on one of the mode buttons labeled "TYPE 1" to "TYPE 4" to select the board type for the level.
   - Each mode represents a different configuration of objects on the game board.

2. **Playing the Game**:
   - After selecting a mode, the game will transition to the level screen.
   - On the level screen, you will see a grid representing the game board.
   - Click on the emitter nodes (marked by circles) to emit light. Each click increases the light intensity.
   - Light will propagate through reflective and opaque nodes based on their properties.
   - Use the objects on the board to manipulate the direction of light and achieve complete illumination.

3. **Inputting Seed**:
   - At the bottom of the level screen, you can input a seed value using the keyboard.
   - The seed value determines the random configuration of objects on the board.
   - Press the numeric keys (0-9) to input digits. The seed will update in real-time.
   - Use the backspace key to delete digits if needed.

4. **Exiting the Game**:
   - To return to the menu screen at any time, click on the "BACK" button located at the bottom left corner of the screen.
   - From the menu screen, you can exit the game by closing the window.

5. **Debugging Mode**:
   - Press the 'D' key to toggle debug mode. In this mode, object types are displayed as characters for debugging purposes.
